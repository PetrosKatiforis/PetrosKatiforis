## Favourite tools

I use nvim for all my projects ([You can find my config file here](https://github.com/Petros-K/NvimConfig)). I run arch linux with i3 and my setup is relatively barebones. <br />
For my frontend applications, I usually go with React but I'm currently exploring Svelte as a more performant alternative. <br />
I'm also learning Rust and I sometimes find myself creating some small games using Godot

## Projects I'm proud of

- [React + Typescript, Windows 11 Browser Clone](https://github.com/Petros-K/Windows11-BrowserClone)
- [Vanilla Javascript Minesweeper](https://github.com/Petros-K/JavascriptMinesweeper)
- [Synonimologos, A Greek synonyms-finder application](https://github.com/PetrosKatiforis/Synonimologos)
