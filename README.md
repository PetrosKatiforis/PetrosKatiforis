## Favourite tools

I use nvim for all my projects ([You can find my config file here](https://github.com/Petros-K/NvimConfig)). I run arch linux with i3 and my setup is relatively barebones. <br />
For my frontend applications, I'm experienced with React but I'm currently exploring Svelte as a more performant alternative. <br />
I'm also learning C and I sometimes find myself creating some sdl2 games

I'm an active advocate of free as in freedom software
