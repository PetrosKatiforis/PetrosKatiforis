I'm an aspiring software developer studying in Athens, Greece. <br />
Even though most of my projects are centered around web development, I enjoy trying out all sorts of new technologies

## Favourite tools

I use nvim for all my projects. I run linux and my setup is relatively barebones. <br />
For my frontend applications, I usually go with React but I'm currently exploring Svelte as a more performant alternative.

## Projects I'm proud of

- [React + Typescript, Windows 11 Browser Clone](https://github.com/Petros-K/Windows11-BrowserClone)
- [Vanilla Javascript Minesweeper](https://github.com/Petros-K/JavascriptMinesweeper)
